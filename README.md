## Commit 1 Reflection Notes
The function `handle_connection`, reads an incoming HTTP request from a `TcpStream`. It creates a buffered reader (`BufReader`) to efficiently read lines from the stream, collecting them into a vector (`http_request`) until it encounters an empty line, which marks the end of the request headers. Finally, it prints the collected request lines for debugging or logging purposes.
